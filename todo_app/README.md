# TASK LIST 2023 WITH LOCALSTORAGE
Browser Based Task List as a Web Application

Application Overview / Summary
This Task List application allows a website visitor to create a new task,
delete their tasks (using a web browser like Firefox or Chrome). There are no accounts, no
service logins and no software to download. The data entered lives only on the device from
which it is created.

There are only four pages to the entire site (index.html, about.html and privacy.html) one style sheet: main.css, and one main JavaScript file to control app functions:
main.js. The site makes use of Bootstrap version 5 for layout and convenience.
The site features six buttons (Select Business Category), (Select Personal Category), (Add task – saves task), (Delete - erase a single task), (Delete - erase a single task) and (Done – check off task).

The quantity (total number) of tasks that can be created, and the length of each task created is
limited by the storage capacity of the browser’s implementation of the HTML-5 localStorage
standard. This means that some users will have larger storage areas than others, and the exact
size of storage is subject to change over time. Typical local storage area is from 2 – 10 MB with
5 MB being average.
